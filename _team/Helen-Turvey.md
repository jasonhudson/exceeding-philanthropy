 Helen Turvey (King) has been at the Foundation for almost a decade, driving the evolution from traditional funder to the current co-investment Fellowship model. She is responsible for the Foundations strategic direction and daily executive leadership.

Helen was educated in Europe, South America and the Middle East. With 15 years of experience working with international NGOs and agencies, she is driven by the belief that openness has benefits beyond the obvious. That they offer huge value to education, economies and communities in both the developed and developing worlds.

As well as holding various board positions, Helen is a lover of musicals, has smallholding ambitions (currently 3 hens and a seasonal veggie patch) and is the winner of all internal bowling competitions.
