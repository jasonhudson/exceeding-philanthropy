# Exceeding Philanthropy

Our experiment in philanthropy continues to evolve as we seek alternative funding strategies and explore collaborative ways of working. But these ideas of openness, individuals, and fellowship remain core pieces of the puzzles we are trying to solve: to make philanthropy more effective, provide better support for our fellows, and enable lasting social change.
