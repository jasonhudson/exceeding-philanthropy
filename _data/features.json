Investing in and supporting them to work on what is broken in their world, equips them to continue to affect change far beyond the life of a specific project or organisation.",

    "description": "When crafting innovative solutions to social challenges, no step-by-step guide or external expert can offer the support you need to keep on experimenting, testing, failing and fighting. A network of peers with a comparable frame of reference, learning and evolving as they travel along similar roads, helps accelerate the journey and amplify useful truths along the way.",

    "description": "Realising a big vision requires many incremental steps and involves a lot of uncertainty. Each step affects change in a tiny way, shifts the environment and establishes a new norm over time. In order to continue driving the change you want to see in the world, you have to be willing and able to adapt, evolve and pivot.",

    "description": "Intellectual property that is both legally and technically open allows others to adopt, replicate, reuse, adapt, improve, bring to scale, write about, talk about, remix, translate, digitise, redistribute and build upon it. These freedoms are key to the results of intellectual and financial investment getting to intended and unintended beneficiaries and removes the constraints of time and money available to the creator.",
